Simple Monte Carlo Simulation on Python

# What is Monte Carlo Simulatuon? 

Monte Carlo simulation is basically building thousands of models with different scenario outcomes. By using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.

It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete. Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.

# Where Monte Carlo Simulation is mainly used?

In finance, project management, energy, manufacturing, research, risk analysis and in many more areas Monte Carlo simulation is used to measure or account for risk and decision making.
