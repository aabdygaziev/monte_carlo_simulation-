# what is Monte Carlo Simulatuon? 

Monte Carlo simulation is basically building thousands of models with different scenario outcomes. By using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.
